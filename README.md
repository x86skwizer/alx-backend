- Node.js (>= 14)
- Docker (optional, for containerized setups)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/x86skwizer/alx-backend.git
   cd alx-backend
   ```

2. Set up virtual environments and install dependencies for each project:

   For Python projects:

   ```bash
   cd project1
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For Node.js projects:

   ```bash
   cd project2
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project

Instructions for running each project can be found in their respective `README.md` files within the project directories.

For example, to run a Flask project:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=src/app.py
flask run
```

Or to run a Node.js project:

```bash
node src/index.js
```
